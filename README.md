# The National Pok√©dex Game üåæ

## Background

The JavaScript Color Game is a popular introductory DOM manipulation project. FreeCodeCamp.org have a tutorial on it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-how-to-manipulate-the-dom-by-building-a-simple-javascript-color-game-1a3aec1d109a/). It's a fun project, and well worth a go if you haven't done it before.

I decided to create a variant of the color game with two core differences from the original:
- It would be a [React.js app](https://github.com/facebook/react) with component based architecture 
- It would use data fetched from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) (a Pok√©mon API) instead of colors

This game is the outcome. You can play it [here](https://devarrowsmith.github.io/national-pokedex-game/).

## Motivation

One week I decided to take a break from work and education. I wanted to create something just for fun. 

The idea of creating a variant of the Color Game using the PokeAPI had been in my mind for a while but it was a low priority project. I decided to implement this as a React app so that I could improve my React skills while making something nice just for me üòä‚ú®

Rather than controlling the UI via direct DOM manipulation this version of the game relies on state updates and component re-renders. In functional terms it's very similar to the JavaScript color game, but in structural terms it's quite different.
