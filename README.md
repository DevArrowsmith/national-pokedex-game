## The National Pokédex Game

A popular introduction to DOM manipulation is the JavaScript Color Game. FreeCodeCamp.org have a tutorial on it [here.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-how-to-manipulate-the-dom-by-building-a-simple-javascript-color-game-1a3aec1d109a/) It's a fun project, and well worth a go if you haven't done it before.

I decided to create a variant of the color game with two core differences from the original:
- It would be a React.js app with component based architecture 
- It would use data fetched from the [PokéAPI (Pokémon https://pokeapi.co/) instead of colors

This game is the outcome. You can play it [here.](https://gummicode.github.io/national-pokedex-game/)
